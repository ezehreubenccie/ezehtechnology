if i pass one of the tags

a) does the tasks execute? No, it doesn't execute.

b) why not? because tags do not get propagated down the subtask as seen below

ansible-playbook --list-tasks exercise1c.yml --tags foo1

playbook: exercise1c.yml

  play #1 (local): exercise1c	TAGS: []
    tasks:


c) how would you correct the main pb such that the subtask would execute, if you use the sub-task corresponding tag?
use  tag: always in the main pb.
