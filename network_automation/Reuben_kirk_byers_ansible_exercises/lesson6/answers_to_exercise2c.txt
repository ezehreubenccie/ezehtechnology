a) what happens upon ansible-playbook execution when you pass a tag that exists in the subtask? Does the subtask execute
or not? it executes because import_tasks is ignored. The subtask executes the task with the specified task.

ansible-playbook --list-tasks exercise2c.yml --tags foo1

playbook: exercise2c.yml

  play #1 (local): exercise2c	TAGS: []
    tasks:
      debug	TAGS: [foo1]


b) why does the subtask execute.? It executes because import_task is ignored and it is as if import task wasnt called 
in the playbook.
